WEEKLY GOALS:

-a realizaiton hits that if i plan at all to incorporate server specific databases, should do that before creating more commands as will need to change ALL code and queries to context specific databases
-create 3 new analysis commands (0/3)

-verify full functionality of existing analysis comands 
>num: 
>Word_Count:
>Longest average: 
>HeatMap: 
-go through code and add comments for my reunderstanding of code 

-integrate codeclean into bot

-create function that allows for combining of name terms (so multiple tuppers adressing same character can be treated as one. 

-add local enviroment handling so I dont leak my bot token and can make this github public 
(DONE 11/3/25)

BRAIN DUMPS: 
>I keep thinking about how I want to make this accesible in multiple servers, creating another databse "master" that creates a nexus for all servers so it would need, the name/id of the server, an authorized user section for data changing, a designated data base, a time zone to display all data in, a password to give authroity, etc.
>in terms of this thinking of creating a whole setup command that takes user through this process to set columns in this master database
>with channel scraping, considering making it so bot scrapes all channels available to it, and instructing user to create roles that hide it from other roles, as creating a channel_ID in master would need to be long list of ID's and unconfident about ability to design bot around this
>REALLY late game (like cant even afford to think about right now) later on maybe training AI to recognize users requests and direct them to specific commands.
